Dear fellow developers blogging on Github Pages. For sites hosted on GitHub Pages, HTTPS enforcement is required since June 15, 2016. 

Please enable it on your site as well. ðŸ§™

According to official [Github documentation]("https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/"), it's pretty straightforward:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click ***Settings***.

3. Under "GitHub Pages", select ***Enforce HTTPS***.
