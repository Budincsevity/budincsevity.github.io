Download [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com). It's amazing how fast it is compared to built-in emulator.
There is two price categories for the application. For the testing purposes, and for regular use there is the free version. The installer goes with 20 pre-configured devices, with CPU and OpenGL acceleration. But you can choose the business version, with all functionalities. It's €24.99 per month/per user, or €8.25 for Indie developers.
After the installation you should download the Genymotion plugin for Android Studio or Eclipse. With the plugin you can build you app directly to Genymotion emulator.
