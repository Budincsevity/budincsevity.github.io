On IO Google unveiled the new Photos service. It's the third (?) attempt from Google, after Picasa and Google+ Photos, to make it easier to upload and organize your photos online.
Or offline if you are using one of their apps. With Photos you get an unlimited storage for your photos and videos. Up to photos with 16MP resolution and Full HD videos.

But there is a thing. Google compresses all you photos after uploading them. All of them. Even below 16MP resolution. Can you notice the difference between compressed and original photos?
I compared a couple of photos and here are the results.
